## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("vegan")
```

Now we are going to load the ggplot2 package and map a scatter plot of speed vs dist from the cars dataset

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(cars, mapping = aes(x = dist, y = speed)) + geom_point() + labs(title = "Scatter Plot of Cars Data",
       x = "Distance",
       y = "Speed")
```
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
docker pull --platform=linux/amd64 nextgenusfs/funannotate
```
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
conda create -n sequali-env python=3.1.0 -c conda-forge
conda activate sequali-env
conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda sequali
```
